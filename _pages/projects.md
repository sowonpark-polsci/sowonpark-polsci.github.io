"The Structure of Foreign Policy Preferences in the U.S. Congress"</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px;">
What motivates legislators to support or oppose foreign policy? In my dissertation, I build a composite model that examines the interplay between ideology and party, offering a more nuanced understanding of how legislative preferences are structured in foreign policy. Legislators develop personal preferences regarding whether and how the United States should engage in world affairs, which may not always align with the positions of the president or their party. Existing measures of legislators’ policy preferences, often based on roll call records, tend to overestimate partisan competition rather than reflect members’ personal ideological preferences. To investigate how legislators' personal ideological preferences and partisan motivations collectively shape their foreign policy preferences and decisions, my dissertation analyzes more than 100,000 Senate floor speeches on diverse foreign policy issues from 1947 to 2020. Using supervised machine learning, I measure senators' isolationist, cooperative internationalist, and militant internationalist preference.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; margin-left: 3em; margin-bottom:0">What kinds of elite messages move public opinion on policy issues? It is well-established that a cue-giver's political party plays a significant role in shaping the effectiveness of cues on public opinion. The effects of political <em>ideology</em>, however, are less well understood, in part because ideology and party are closely intertwined in the realm of domestic politics. In this study, we disentangle the effects of party and ideology by examining elite cues in the context of American foreign policy. Foreign policy is a useful area to study the distinct effects of political ideology because foreign policy ideology is not always a reliable indicator of elites' partisan affiliations. We conducted three pre-registered survey experiments on nationally representative samples of 12,600 American adults in an effort to assess how elites' foreign policy ideological beliefs shape the effectiveness of policy cues. The results suggest that political ideology plays a significant and distinct role in shaping voters' policy attitudes.</p>
