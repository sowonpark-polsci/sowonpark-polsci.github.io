Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Politics at the University of Virginia. My research interests focus on international security, U.S. foreign policy, legislative behavior, public opinion, and political psychology.

My dissertation explores the ideological nature of foreign policy preferences among U.S. legislators and public opinion. Using various methodologies, including machine learning, text-as-data, survey experiments, and statistical methods, I study how personal ideological preferences and partisan motivations collectively shape foreign policy behaviors of legislators and the public, and how this, in turn, influences the outcomes of interstate bargaining.

I have been a graduate research fellow at the National Security Policy Center in the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy (2022-23), the Quantitative Collaborative (2021-22), and the Democratic Statecraft Lab (2020-22) at the University of Virginia. My dissertation is supported by the Albert Gallatin Fellowship funds from the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation.
